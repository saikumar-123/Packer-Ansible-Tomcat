Step1:

mkdir -p ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws
cd ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws

Step2: Under created directory, create folders for Packer, Ansible provisioners and where the Application source code/build packages are placed.


mkdir -p ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws/packer/provisioners/{ansible,scripts}
mkdir -p ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws/packer/provisioners/ansible/{templates,files}
mkdir -p ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws/src/application


This is my initial project tree.
$ cd ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws
$ tree
.
├── packer
│   └── provisioners
│       ├── ansible
│       └── scripts
└── src
    └── application



Step 3: 

cd packer
vim packer-build.json


Step 4:

cd ~/projects/packer-ansible-aws/packer
packer build -machine-readable packer-build.json | tee build_artifact.txt
